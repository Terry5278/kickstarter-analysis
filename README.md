# Analysis of Kickstarter Projects as Related to Success Goal
### Purpose
For this project I have analyzed myriad Kickstarter projects dating as far back as 2013 using Microsoft Excel.
The purpose of this project was to provide my client with optimal targeting for her own project, raising funds for a new theater production. As I will show through the course of this analysis both the time of year and size of goal correlate to the success of a given project through Kickstarter. It is my hope that drawing from these insights will allow the client to launch and execute a successful funding endeavor through Kickstarter leading to a fiscal environment conducive to a successful creative production.
## Analysis and Challenges
While working through the raw data provided by Kickstarter I keyed in on two key metrics which I believe will be most impactful when creating a fundraising source for the production, namely the time of year in which the project is launched and the size of the initial goal for the offering. I will provide my own insight along with simple charts to emphasize my observations. I believe that following the recommendations gleaned from this data will result in more funds captured and, ultimately, a more successful production.
The main challenge in this analysis lies with the fact that all of the data at my disposal was gleaned from Kickstarter. As this is analysis around funding for a *creative* project it would have been helpful to assess some quantifiable metrics as to the cache of the projects involved. The blurbs provided by Kickstarter did not give me enough information to evaluate for expected audience reception based on artist reputation, proposed initial venue, artist collaboration or past critical reception. In short I was left with analysis of Kickstarter projects *in a vacuum*. As such I believe this data set to contain outliers and aberrant points which I was unequipped to account for. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	The most salient insight drawn from the data can be gleaned almost immediately from this image:

Projects launched in the summer months perform significantly more successfully against their goal than at any other time of year. This holds true not only across all plays but Kickstarter projects in general. More liquid capital available to prospective backers, more free time, and a *sunnier* disposition in general appears to lead to more willingness to support speculative ventures in general and the arts in particular. My second insight would be that launching a campaign during a time of year when discretionary income is already accounted for like the winter holidays would make the campaign less likely to succeed.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	My next focal point was the initial goal put forward by projects on Kickstarter. I believed that the initial sticker shock of an extremely high goal or the lack of perceived return from a prohibitively modest one should affect backer engagement. 

The data bore out my assumptions as demonstrated in the image above. There appears to be a sweet spot between 35 and 45 thousand dollars of initial investment and another at the lower end of the scale between 1 and 5 thousand dollars.
## Results
It is my recommendation that the client launch her Kickstarter campaign in May. I would also recommend breaking out her projects into separate initiatives totaling no more than $5,000 with specific and easily understood deliverables. Given more time I believe further analysis marketing efforts and spend against number of backers and average donation would be useful. Further charts could be provided around the word count of the Kickstarter blurb, the duration of the campaign and the country of focus against number of backers and total expenditure.
